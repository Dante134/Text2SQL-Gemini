# Text2SQL-Gemini
This project demonstrates an end-to-end app that uses Google Gemini Pro to convert natural language into SQL queries, enabling seamless database interaction. With an interactive Streamlit interface and a SQLite database, users can input questions, and the app generates and executes complex SQL queries to retrieve data.
